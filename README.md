# Property Assessment Prediction Values

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting property assessment values using various machine learning algorithms. By analyzing historical data on property sales, tax assessments, and other relevant features, we aim to build a model that can accurately predict the value of a property. This tool is invaluable for real estate investors, homeowners, and financial institutions in making informed decisions.

1. Clone the repository:
2. Install the required dependencies: git clone https://github.com/beve0x/property-assessment-prediction.git
## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleansing and preparing historical property data for analysis.
- **Feature Engineering**: Identifying and creating new features that improve model accuracy.
- **Model Training**: Implementation of various regression models to predict property values.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Square Error).

## Data Description

The dataset comprises historical property sales records, including features such as property size, location, age, tax assessment values, and sale price. Note: You may need to provide a link to the dataset or further describe its structure, depending on the project's data privacy and sharing policies.

## Modeling and Evaluation

We experimented with multiple regression models, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest Regressors. The evaluation is based on splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, with model performance measured by RMSE.
